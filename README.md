## 📌 Run The Prism Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (preferably the latest stable version)
- Git installed on your machine

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/gugasanchez/theprism.git
cd theprism
```

### Setting up the Frontend
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified in the console output).

### Setting up the Backend

#### ⚠ The code within the_prism_diffusion directory is intended for research and development purposes, aimed at continuing the effort to execute Stable Diffusion on Cartesi. We have made significant progress in running it with Docker, but we are currently encountering a cache issue when downloading the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model.

#### Therefore, please do not attempt to run this directory; it is meant to be finalized in the continuation of the development process.
